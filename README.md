Hi folks! This is a great way to see what MCP client-server interactions do under-the-hood. This repo includes all the code necessary to spin up a local mcp server, then while using MCP Visual Inspector you can run the workflow of "Tell me what resources you have" or "Tell me what tools you have" along with interactions with said tools.

Step 1. Install the dependencies
`npm install`

Step 2. Navigate to the directory

Step 3.
`npm run build`

Step 4. Run the Inspector (from the same directory)
`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js`
